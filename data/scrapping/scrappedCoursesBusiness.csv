ECO341,Economic Development,8,"Economic development is the process of gradual improvement in the material well-being of individuals. At the macro level, development economics studies why some countries have high standards of living, while others do not. At the micro level, development studies the functioning of markets in low income countries, with the ultimate goal of addressing market failures and lifting individuals out of poverty. Almost all topics in economics have a counterpart in development economics. The context of developing countries proves to be challenging for conventional economic models due to the prevalence of market failures. The situation often requires a careful investigation of the plausibility of assumptions in a developing context. Based on that, the course will cover mainly, among other topics, analytical approaches to the economic problems of developing nations.

EL118,Reading Comprehension,4,"This is a four-credit-hour module of one semester in length. The module aims to help students become better readers of English texts and build their vocabulary. It focuses on expanding students’ reading skills and vocabulary use so that they can cope with different academic, professional and social situations effectively. The course applies the Interactive Reading model where reading is an active process in which readers draw upon top-down processing (bringing meaning to the text), as well as bottom-up processing (decoding words and other details of language). The top-down aspect of this construct suggests that reading is facilitated by interesting and relevant reading materials that activate a range of knowledge in a reader's mind. This knowledge is refined and extended during the act of reading. The bottom-up aspect of this model suggests that the students need to pay attention to language proficiency, including vocabulary. As an academic reading course, it addresses the teaching of higher level reading strategies without neglecting the need for language support. In addition, it addresses both sides of the interactive model. High-interest academic readings and activities provide students with opportunities to draw upon authentic life experience in their mastery of a wide variety of reading strategies and skills, including • previewing • outlining • skimming and scanning • using context clues to clarify meaning • finding the main idea • isolating causes and effects • annotating and highlighting • categorizing • interpreting visuals • describing trends • making inferences. • understanding analogies • analysing criteria • analysing advantages and disadvantages • identifying ethics and values • synthesizing information from several sources • summarizing • evaluating generalizations The course optimizes the reciprocal relationship between reading and vocabulary. Rich vocabulary instruction and practice that targets vocabulary from the Academic Word List (AWL) provide opportunities for students to improve their language proficiency and their ability to decode and process vocabulary. The course also provides some resources to help students read with comprehension and use that knowledge to develop both a rich academic vocabulary and overall academic language proficiency, especially reading skills.

As such the course reverses the balance present in other OUBS courses where communication skills are fore grounded but are always at the service of the course content and consequently occupy a less significant position in the learning outcomes.    The model of communication skill development outlined above is a positive rather than a deficit model. It draws on current thinking about literacy development in which a more traditional skills development model which treats communication as an all-purpose set of skills with universal application is overlain, firstly, with a model that places literacy in context and sees literacy practices as situated within particular spheres of activity (in this case, business, broadly, and business studies more specifically).

SYS210,Managing Technologies and Innovation,8,"Technology plays a significant and invaluable role in the different aspects of human societies. It is a key resource of profound importance for a nation’s security and economic development. In addition, it is viewed as an important strategic factor and fundamental element for economic growth and as an instrumental means of controlling nature and resources. It also exerts a powerful influence on standards of living and quality of life. New knowledge, innovations and professional skills are an intrinsic part of new technology. Because technology is continuously changing, with new processes and products being developed or improved regularly, the need to manage technology is also continuous, and one that grows with the expansion of economic activities. Management of technology is a difficult and complex process, but it is an issue that faces all firms today. It involves the handling of technical and social issues in a broad spectrum of functional areas including manufacturing, design, development, information, processing, construction, pollution, violence, and so forth. Management of technology and innovation is concerned with developing and enhancing the capabilities of individuals and the characteristics of institutions to match the potential benefits, to contain the hazards resulting from technological change and also to find new ways to compete and survive. The role of MTI (Managing Technology and Innovation) is to ensure the proper execution of the following functions:     Selection of technology, or rather technological products     Effective negotiation and contracting for their acquisition     To integrate strategy and technology     Adaptation to local conditions (environmental, human, etc.).     Insights into MTI (Managing Technology and Innovation)",B123,"​The aim of this module, after accomplishing both parts of it, is to familiarize students with an integrative approach to the management of technology and innovation.It introduces the concept of MTI and examines internal innovation planning, implementation and evaluation and control. It also introduces building the capabilities necessary for MTI success.At the end of both parts of the module, students are expected to attain the following objectives:Understand the significance of technology, innovation and their managementIdentify the key MTI concerns in strategyUnderstand both product and process innovationRecognize the foundations of internal innovation and its implementationDetermine if the firm has achieved the desired outcomes and design a proper tool for evaluation and controlIdentify elements for planning for acquiring, implementing and evaluating technologyUnderstand the core capabilities for a sustainable competitive advantageDetermine what information the firm actually has and to turn this information into knowledgeThe course will prepare students with practical skills through numerous realistic settings that are in line with the Quality Assurance Agency’s benchmark statement expectations for business studies. It also aims to enhance employability as the curriculum is of benefit to students in the employment market and also relevant to many studying for their own personal development. In so doing, the course provides students with a clear understanding and appreciation of innovation dynamics both within and across firm’s boundaries. By drawing from state of the art innovation literatures as well as the extensive use of in-depth case study materials, the course analyses opportunities and challenges related to creating, sustaining , managing innovation and most of all integrating strategy and technology, with a specific focus on technology-based organizations.​​","​A.

SYS280,Principles and Practice of Systems’ Thinking,8,"Traditionally, problems are frequently tackled by employing simple and convenient methods to achieve simple solutions. Such simple and popular approaches are not effective in solving complex, dynamic and diverse problems.  Regardless of the preliminary seemingly simple and easy application, the emphasis seems to be on the elements of the problem, rather than the “bigger picture”. Thus, no attention is given to the interaction between the elements, with the belief that there is one best solution.  As program failures intensify there is a growing need to develop and generate improved outcomes through systems thinking.  Systems’ thinking is a discipline of seeing the “whole”, recognizing patterns and interrelationships, and learning how to innovate a more effective, efficient and creative system/holistic solution(s).     Holistic Systems Thinking considers the interdependent, inter-relational, and contextual aspects of phenomena and applies an integrated, inclusive mindset to problem solving.  Holistic approaches are preoccupied with the assumptions, knowledge, methods, and implications of various disciplines and treats them as an integrated whole, or system. Systems can be ecological, social, institutional, or a combination of all three, and relationships, within and between systems are recognized as complex with cyclical interdependencies, or  feedbacks. Higher-order, or emergent, properties become evident when systems are considered in this integrated fashion.    A holistic systems world-view is grounded in people taking responsibility for their own actions and being receptive to transformational change. Fundamental to this philosophy are personal beliefs that sustainability is a conscious choice by people to aspire to a purposeful and equitable integration of a systems view of life. Holism can be referred to using different terminology including ecological systems thinking, and ‘joined-up’ mindset.    This course will acquaint students with the basic concepts of systems thinking.  The primary emphasis will be the introduction of basic systems thinking fundamentals, i.e. defining a systems perspective about any situation or problem, solving problems with that perspective, drawing appropriate diagrams to illustrate the problem, describing and modeling a problem, and designing and improving upon system solutions.",B207B,"​​SYS280 is a compulsory course in Business Studies/Systems' track.  Systems thinking is an inquiry-based method of learning that uses the technique of perspective-taking, fosters holistic thinking, and engages in belief-testing. Systems theory identifies and analyzes the linkages among various elements in a system. For those new to systems theory, it is important to note that “systems"" is plural. Thus, systems theory does not presume that there is one grand system to be studied. One intellectual thread of systems theory is the field of systems thinking. Systems thinking is a methodology for understanding and managing complex feedback systems such as the ones at work in business and other social systems. Systems thinking uses mapping of interrelationships as a mean to improve decision-maker understanding of how to intervene and improve system performance.Understanding the interworking of a system, or the relationships between the various actors of a system, is useful because it improves understanding of the outcomes of the system. For example, to understand why communities experience traffic congestion in a road system despite extensive road building requires an understanding of the relationships between the actors in the system. Students must understand how governments decide where to build or expand roads and how individuals select driving routes. If a government widens a congested road, it is likely to become congested again even if the destinations of current drivers, employment patterns, location of entertainment and service venues, and other determinants of driving patterns have not changed. The systems thinking approach builds theories for how the system works and uses them to develop insights about the behavior of the system over time, with the goal of improving system performance. The primary tools of systems thinking include system diagramming.After completing this course student will have opportunities to conduct inquire into, and represent their learning about holistic systems. Learning objectives might include:Provide an overview of the history, research and perspectives into systems thinking.Understand and document system thinking objectives.Demonstrate a capacity to appreciate that all actions have consequences within, between and among systems.Establish a basic understanding of systems thinking terminology, theories, processes, methods, language and tools.Understand how tipping points, interdependencies, feedback loops, and emergent properties impact a variety of social, economic and ecological systems.Describe and model solutions that will enable system thinking ex. (mind maps, feedback & causal loops, behavior over time diagrams, etc.)Apply systems analysis to various problems (socio - technical, supply chain, value chain / lean, etc.).Comprehend systemic limits such as carrying capacity and the ways humans can and do impact ecological systems.Develop a set of diagramming techniques. This help in exploring your perceptions and understanding of a situation and in communicating this understanding to others. Specifically, you will:Recognize how diagrams can be used to support thinking about complex situations.Understand how diagrams can be used to develop and represent systems of interest within a complex situation.Know the main types of diagrams which are most frequently used in systems thinking and practice, the purpose they serve and the conventions they use.​​","A.

SYS380,Managing Systems Complexity,8,"Engage students  with an awareness of the issues involved in managing change, moving them beyond ""one-best way"" approaches and providing them with access to multiple perspectives that they can draw upon in order to enhance their success in producing organizational change. These multiple perspectives provide a theme for the text as well as a framework for the way each chapter outlines different options open to managers in helping them to identify, in a reflective way, the actions and choices open to them. Multiple perspectives ensure that change managers are not trapped by a ""one-best way"" of approaching change that limits their options for action. Changing organizations is as messy as it is exhilarating, as frustrating as it is satisfying, as muddling-through and creative a process as it is a rational one. The module provides the student with an exploration into the tensions for those involved in managing organizational change. Rather than pretend that they do not exist it confronts them head on, identifying why they are there, how they can be managed and the limits they create for what the manager of organizational change can achieve.",SYS280,"Develop students with  a multiple perspectives approach to managing changeRecognizes the variety of strategies to facilitate change interventionsReinforce students approach for the need for a tailored and creative approach to fit different contextsIntroduce the student to new and emerging trends, developments, themes, debates, and practices in organizational development and change interventions","A.
