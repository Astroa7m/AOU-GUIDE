EL118,Reading Comprehension,4,"This is a four-credit-hour module of one semester in length. The module aims to help students become better readers of English texts and build their vocabulary. It focuses on expanding students’ reading skills and vocabulary use so that they can cope with different academic, professional and social situations effectively. The course applies the Interactive Reading model where reading is an active process in which readers draw upon top-down processing (bringing meaning to the text), as well as bottom-up processing (decoding words and other details of language). The top-down aspect of this construct suggests that reading is facilitated by interesting and relevant reading materials that activate a range of knowledge in a reader's mind. This knowledge is refined and extended during the act of reading. The bottom-up aspect of this model suggests that the students need to pay attention to language proficiency, including vocabulary. As an academic reading course, it addresses the teaching of higher level reading strategies without neglecting the need for language support. In addition, it addresses both sides of the interactive model. High-interest academic readings and activities provide students with opportunities to draw upon authentic life experience in their mastery of a wide variety of reading strategies and skills, including • previewing • outlining • skimming and scanning • using context clues to clarify meaning • finding the main idea • isolating causes and effects • annotating and highlighting • categorizing • interpreting visuals • describing trends • making inferences. • understanding analogies • analysing criteria • analysing advantages and disadvantages • identifying ethics and values • synthesizing information from several sources • summarizing • evaluating generalizations The course optimizes the reciprocal relationship between reading and vocabulary. Rich vocabulary instruction and practice that targets vocabulary from the Academic Word List (AWL) provide opportunities for students to improve their language proficiency and their ability to decode and process vocabulary. The course also provides some resources to help students read with comprehension and use that knowledge to develop both a rich academic vocabulary and overall academic language proficiency, especially reading skills.

TM351,Data management and analysis,8,"Data management and analysis (TM351) – an overview of the concepts, techniques, and tools of modern data management and analysis. The requirements of data management continually evolve.  Recently those requirements have surpassed the capabilities of traditional data management.  So, in order to better prepare our graduates for the new demands of the job market, it is necessary to address both the traditional concepts of data management as well as the increasingly important area of data analytics.",,"This module aims to address some of the key concepts required for the traditionally important area of data management, and the increasingly important area of data analytics. The module will compare traditional relational databases with an alternate model (a NoSQL database), and will enable students to choose between the alternatives to select an appropriate means of storing and managing data, depending on the size and structure of a particular dataset and the use to which that data will be put. Students will be introduced to preliminary techniques in data analysis, starting from the position that data is used to answer a question, and introduced to a range of data visualisation and visual analysis techniques that will instil an understanding of how to start exploring a new data set.To ensure that students are comfortable with handling datasets, they will explore a range of openly licensed real-world datasets (either downloaded from their host websites, or provided as snapshots) to illustrate the key concepts in the course. Sources such as data.gov.uk, the World Bank, and a range of other national and international agencies will be used to provide appropriate data. The module will aim to divide approximately equally between issues in data management (technical and socio-legal issues in storing and maintaining datasets), and issues in data analytics (using data to answer questions). Students are not expected to have a background in statistics, but should be comfortable working with mathematical concepts and will need to be competent programmers.The module will be framed around a narrative that looks at how to manage and extract value and insight from a range of increasingly large data collections. At each stage, a comparison will be drawn between different ways of representing the data (for example, using different sorts of charts or geographical mapping techniques), and limitations of the mechanisms presented. To enable students to get a feel for the use of data, each stage will also include an overview of some data analysis techniques, including summary reporting and exploratory data visualisation. The module will be driven by Richard Hamming's famous quote: The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.Some of the key ideas are:Introducing data analysis. Starting with a text based data file such as comma separated variable (CSV) document, this unit will provide a brief introduction to some basic operations on simple data files. This will give an opportunity to provide an outline of the key ideas in the module, to ensure that the students have installed the module software correctly, and to begin to familiarise themselves with that software.Concepts in data management. The module will look at three key areas in data management: data architectures and data access (CRUD), data integrity, and transaction management (ACID). Each of these will be illustrated using a relational database, and one non-relational alternative, and the advantages and limitations of each model discussed.Legal and ethical issues. The module will consider the legal and ethical issues involved in managing data collections. Students will be required to obtain and read (parts of) the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act, and demonstrate how these apply to issues in data management. They will also consider privacy, ownership, intellectual property and licensing issues in data collection, management, retrieval and reuse.Concepts in data analytics. These sections will focus on using data to answer a real question; the focus will be on exploratory techniques (such as visualisation) and formulating a question into a form which can realistically be answered using the data that is available. Issues in processing techniques for large and real-time streamed data collections will also be addressed along with techniques and technologies (such as mapreduce) for handling them. This part will use a statistical package such as the python scientific libraries and/or ggplot to visualise the data and carry out appropriate analyses.

TM356,Interaction design and user experience,8,"Interaction design and the user experience (TM356) – in this module the students will learn the importance of user-centred design, and acquire practical skills for designing the interactive products for everyday life. From apps, phones and business systems to wearables, the web and the Internet of Things, interactive products are the stuff of everyday life. But how can interactions be designed to best meet their purposes, offer good user experiences, and be easy, satisfying and enjoyable to use? How can interactions be evaluated effectively when their users, purposes and contexts of use vary so widely? In this module we take a user-centred approach through which the student will learn about the factors, techniques, tools and theories that affect interaction design and acquire practical skills that will equip the student to analyse, design, and evaluate the interactive products of everyday life. Why are some interactive products so popular? How do you create products that everybody wants?
